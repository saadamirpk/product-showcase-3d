## About the Project

An interactive 3D product visualizer with color picker built with Three.js, React Three Fiber, and React. It is a useful tool for e-commerce websites or other online platforms that sell physical products. It allows users to view a 3D model of the product from different angles and customize its appearance by changing the color and other visual aspects.

To build this tool, I started by setting up a basic 3D scene using Three.js and React Three Fiber. This involves creating a renderer, camera, and scene, as well as adding lighting and any necessary materials or textures.

Next, I added the 3D models to the scene. Adjusted the scale and rigged the materials to be grouped appropriately with the mesh parts. The models can be created from scratch or imported from a 3D modeling software such as Blender.

To allow the user to customize the appearance of the product, I then implemented a color picker UI element that allows the user to select different parts of the mesh and edit the visual options. Then update the material of the product model based on the user's selection.

Finally, I added add any desired visual effects, as well as any necessary user interface elements, such as buttons to rotate the model or zoom in and out.

Overall, an interactive 3D product visualizer with color picker built with Three.js, React Three Fiber, and React can be a useful and engaging tool for online shopping platforms, allowing users to get a better sense of the appearance and dimensions of a product before purchasing.
